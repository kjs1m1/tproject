        <p>Trump himself aggressively squelched the one defense that could ease the political pain of moderate Republican lawmakers. He warned that it would be unacceptable for any Republican to argue his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was inappropriate but did not meet the constitutional standards for removal.
            "Republicans, don't be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable. No, it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!" Trump tweeted Sunday.
            Fierce political exchanges over the weekend offered a preview of how Republicans and Democrats will joust for advantage when the televised hearings get underway on Wednesday.
            Republicans will seek to deflect, take the investigation down political rabbit holes and create a spectacle with an eye to Trump's conservative media cheerleaders and his supporters. They will also seek to confuse the case with details and factually dubious arguments designed to complicate it in the eyes of Americans watching the proceedings.
            Democrats will battle to keep their simple abuse of power case from being corrupted by Republican attacks. They will try to turn the public against Trump by using witnesses drawn from political and military service  like the current top US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday and the ousted US ambassador to the country, Marie Yovanovitch, on Friday.
            "They are going to hear immensely patriotic, beautifully articulate people telling the story of a President who ... extorted a vulnerable country by holding up military aid," Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said on NBC's "Meet the Press."     </p>

        President Moon Jae-in hinted at officially terminating an intel-sharing pact with Japan unless Tokyo withdraws its earlier decision to remove Seoul from its list of most trusted business partners, an official at the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) said, Monday. “During Sunday's dinner meeting with chiefs of the major five political parties at Cheong Wa Dae, President Moon told them Seoul's earlier decision not to renew the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan was a matter of principle,” a DPK official said, adding DPK Chairman Rep. Lee Hae-chan shared the specifics of the dinner meeting with senior party members.</p>
